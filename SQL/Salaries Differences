Question : Write a query that calculates the difference between the highest salaries found in the marketing and engineering departments. Output just the absolute difference in salaries.


Answer : 

with engineering_s as (SELECT MAX(e.salary) as engineering 
FROM db_employee as e 
INNER JOIN db_dept as d 
ON e.department_id = d.id 
WHERE d.department = 'engineering'
group by d.department),
marketing_s as (SELECT d.department , MAX(e.salary) as marketing 
FROM db_employee as e 
INNER JOIN db_dept as d 
ON e.department_id = d.id 
WHERE d.department = 'marketing'
group by d.department) 
SELECT abs(marketing - engineering)
from engineering_s , marketing_s


Answer 2 : 

SELECT abs(max(engineering_salary) - max(marketing_salary)) as salary_diff 
from (
SELECT 
CASE WHEN d.department = 'engineering' then (e.salary) end as engineering_salary , 
CASE WHEN d.department = 'marketing' then (e.salary) end as marketing_salary 
FROM db_employee as e 
INNER JOIN db_dept as d 
ON e.department_id = d.id ) as tb
